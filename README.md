# 🍅 Tomato Leaf Disease Classification

This project aims to classify tomato leaf diseases using a lightweight machine learning model trained on a diverse dataset. The model is designed to work offline on a mobile app, enabling farmers and agricultural experts to identify and address plant diseases efficiently.

## 🌿 Dataset
The dataset consists of **over 20,000 images** of tomato leaves, covering **10 disease classes** and **1 healthy class**. The images are collected from both laboratory scenes and real-world environments.
